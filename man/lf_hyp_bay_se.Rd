\title{Summarized Experiment of RNA-seq Counts}
\format{
An object of class \code{SummarizedExperiment} with 28395 rows and 16 columns.
}
\usage{
lf_hyp_bay_se
}
\description{
RNA was harvested from proliferating lung fibroblasts after 72 h of treatment
with molidustat or 0.5\% oxygen, separately or together with DMSO as the
vehicle control. RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNAeasy kit and sequenced
at BGI.
}
\details{
Reads were aligned with \code{Rsubread} using release 37 of the
\code{GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz} and annotated with the internal \emph{hg38}
NCBI RefSeq database. Entrez gene IDs were mapped to HGNC symbols and gene
names using \code{biomaRt}. The sequencing results are available from the NIH short
read archive (SRA) and the analysis code is contained in the \code{data-raw}
directory of the package source.
